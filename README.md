# Simple-Obsidian-Vault
My weird obsidian setup, with some weird scripts. 

This is suppose to make writing usefull templater scripts for obsidian easier, **its not a plugin**.

Just download the vault as is and use it as a vault. 

It is still in development and I'm probably going to be slow in developing this.

ducmentiation is at /Templates/UtilityDocumentation
